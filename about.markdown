**My name is Kelly Eckenrode and welcome to "the whole cell"**

I am a microbiologist on a journey to learn bioinfomatics, specifically, while using R. Here, I am documenting my journey. Many biologists want the power to analyze their own data, but it is difficult to make time and learn new tools. I am very privilaged to work with [Levi Waldon](http://github.com/waldronlab) for my post-doc so I can finally learn more about data, how to work with it and what to do with it.

**I like learning about bacteria**

I think they are funny. Being incredibly small and outnumbering humans, they maintain their mysterious status. Bacteria come in many varieties of shapes, sizes, arrangements, communities, and produce an staggering array of metabolites and proteins. Why such a diversity? Why are bacteria so important? What is the role of bacteria in healthy human function? In human development? 

Come along and learn with me!
