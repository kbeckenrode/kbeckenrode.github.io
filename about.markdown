My name is Kelly Eckenrode and welcome to the "the whole cell". 

I am a microbiologist on a journey to learn bioinfomatics, specifically, while using R. Here, I am documenting my journey. So many biologists want the power to analyze their own data, but it difficult to make time and learn new tools. I am very privilaged to work with [Levi Waldon](http://github.com/waldronlab) for my post-doc so I can finally learn more about data, how to work with it and what to do with it.

I like learning about bacteria. I think they are funny. Being incredibly small in comparison to humans, and yet, they remain a such a mystery. Bacteria come in many varieties of shapes, sizes, arrangements, communities, and produce an staggering array of metabolites and proteins. Why such a diversity? Why are bacteria so important? What is the role of bacteria in healthy human function? In development?
