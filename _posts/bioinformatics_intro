# Introduction into Bioinfomatics

**Bioinformatics** is a type of biology that studies the patterns of genomic sequences of DNA, RNA, and proteins. If these are new concepts to you, 
I suggest reading the [NIH Human Genome Introduction] (https://www.genome.gov/About-Genomics/Introduction-to-Genomics) to learn how these molecules are 
composed of repeating strucutures producing a genetic codes. The job of bioinfomatics is learning how to understand these codes and how different layers 
of genetic codes relate to each other. How are these codes responsible for development, age and diease? 

As a primer, let's first define some basic genomics ideas and terms.
